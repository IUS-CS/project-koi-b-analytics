  ## Demo

  This sprint, we completed:

  ### Wins

  * Sexton is amazing
  * Super happy to be able to import the data straight into the DB rather than needing to use something like blob storage to push from CSV's. Thank you for the declutter!
  * Everyone can see and access the database!

  ### Opportunities

  * Another sprint where time got away from us a bit, continue to hold each other accountable and touch base weekly

  ### Commitments

  * Sprint 5 is the end of the finish line. Must get all graphic elements completed and set up the user guide. Test functionality and look for bugs
