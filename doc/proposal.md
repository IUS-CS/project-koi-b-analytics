# Proposal
Koi-B Analytics is a desktop application that aims to make use of player statistics
in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The project will allow users to query
any active player in the NBA and pull up their relevant stat-lines.

Furthermore users will have the opportunity to create their own roster(s) of players
and analyze their statistics via table format, bell curves, and run simple linear
regression on certain specified attributes.
> An example of the above could include viewing the likelihood of a players total
points per game being over 20 when playing a certain team.

The querying tool will connect to a SQL server database comprised of the current seasons
player statistics. Wild cards will be implemented for ease of use when searching players.
Not only will querying a players stat-line be available but grabbing subsets of their statistics
for quick analysis will also be available.

Our intention is that our users will take full advantage of the Koi-B Analytics application
to wither increase their knowledge of the season in real time or use the application to
subdue their fantasy opponents. To ensure live data an html scraper will be ran and updated
via a stored procedure.

Time permitting we would like to include a live scoring, schedule, and twitter feed pane.


# Vision Statement
-For analytics fans and casual National Basketball Association viewers alike.
Koi-B Analytics offers player stat indexing along with a variety of visual tools.

-Unlike most widely used fantasy line-up tools, Koi-B offers in depth breakdowns of
user-created "rosters". Users will be allowed the flexibility to experiment with
different rosters. In a fantasy sports setting this gives the player a competitive
advantage in leveraging trades and making team management decisions.

-Target audiences include enthusiasts of the professional basketball scene who would
like to make use of basketball player(s) stat-lines. Use the desktop application to
build roster(s), find trends, and visualize statistics.
