Testing Method
==================
For this program, we found that it was more complicated to create an automatic
testing system than it would be to simply manually test each aspect of this code.
This is due to the majority of our program opperating on a GUI and passing 
along information based on listeners, rather than typical styles of 
OOP. 
With the use of our database, we found that passing each type of information
yeilded better testing results than if we were to do another type of testing.
To confirm functionality of this program, we pressed each button presented 
several times to ensure that we were getting the expected results with each 
button press. In the text field, we use a wildcard system, and tested the 
accuracy of finding the data based on simple and short text inputs. 
Then, once these particular players were found based on the wildcard information,
we input a series of random characters that would in no way yeild an accurate 
data entry. This functioned as expected, and proved that the program would only 
continue whenever a valid name, or some fraction thereof, was entered into the text 
field.
For further testing, we entered more players than allowed, and found that the list
of players was as long as epected.
